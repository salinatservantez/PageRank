(unix) how do i print something in the lab? (windows) how do i contact the cs system administrator? what does cs mean? cs stands for computer science. how do i use the card reader? make sure the light on the card reader is green. hold your ranger card so that the magnetic strip is on the right and swipe it through the card reader. the light will flash amber. enter your pin using the numbers on the card reader. the light will flash green and the reader will make a beeping sound for 5 seconds. pull the door open before it stops. if the lights flash red, try again. if trying to access the lab fails repeatedly, contact your cs instructor or the cs system administrator. see also: what do i do if the light on the card reader is not green? how do i contact my cs instructor? how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i access my computer account in the cs computer lab? if you qualify, you will be given an account on cs.uwp.edu. before using the account you must fill out and sign a unix account policy form and do the initial setup of your account. for most people, this is done in the first lab of the csci 145 or 241 course. if for some reason you did not activate your account, contact the cs system administrator for assistance. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i choose a good password? the password you select for the cs computer lab must be a minimum of 8 characters long and contain at least one letter at least one number and at least one symbol. your password should be easy for you to remember and secure enough no one can guess it. your password should not contain any public information such as address, phone number, birthday, pet name, etc. which would be easy to find out or guess. your password should be long and should not contain any commonly known words. your password should contain a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and other characters such as punctuation marks or symbols. keep your password secure. this includes not telling anyone what your password is. you should use a different password for every account you access. for greater security, passwords should be changed regularly. see also: what are some methods for choosing a good password? how do i change my cs password? what should i do if i forget my password? what are some methods for choosing a good password? choose a word and replace some of the letters with numbers or symbols so that the original word is unrecognizable. or choose a phrase, such as the first line of your favorite song, use the first letter of each word of the phrase, and insert punctuation marks and numbers. or choose a common word, but as you type it offset your fingers on the keyboard one or two places up, down, or sideways. the typed word will then look like gibberish. or the possibilities are endless, use your own method. see also: how do i choose a good password? how do i change my cs password? what should i do if i forget my password? how do i use the computers in the cs computer lab? (unix) typically, all machines are powered up, with the monitors turned off. turn on monitor. if the screen is black, move the mouse or press the escape key to wake it up. if the screen is locked, or someone forgot to log out, report it to the cs system administrator. enter your cs login and password. remember to log off when done. if you are only going to be gone 2 or 3 minutes, lock your screen and leave your books/papers by the workstation. do not turn off any of the computers. these are accessed from remote locations and others may be using them at the same time. (except for the dual-boot machines. if you are not sure if a machine is dual-boot, do not shut it down or restart it.) if there is a problem with a machine, please notify the cs system administrator. see also: how do i log in to the computers in the cs computer lab? (unix) how do i lock my machine? (unix) how do i log out? (unix) how do i change my cs password? you must change your password on the lab server. from a terminal session logged into the lab: type the command ssh ginger and press enter. if you see a message that looks like the following: the authenticity of host 'ginger (131.210.12.7)' can't be established. rsa key fingerprint is 89:b8:3b:12:7b:c7:0d:93:09:c2:4b:f8:5f:71:7f:6f. are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? type yes and press enter. enter your password. nothing will show up on the screen as you type. this is done for security purposes. you should see this: ==================================================== you may only change your password on this server type ctrl-d to exit without changing your password ==================================================== changing password for username (current) unix password: enter your current password. nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. enter your new password. again, nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. enter your new password again. once again, nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. you will see the message passwd: password updated successfully. the connection will close and you will be returned to the lab machine. see also: how do i choose a good password? what are some methods for choosing a good password? what should i do if i forget my password? how do i get a secure login to the cs computer lab from the outside world? (unix) use ssh (secure shell). secure shell encrypts the terminal connection including your password so no data is transmitted in clear, readable text. the lab machines are not accessible from off campus using telnet or ftp. to access the lab with ssh, you will need to get an ssh client (workstation) software installed on the machine you want to access the lab from. it should be installed by default on a unix machine. to access the lab type the command ssh -l <login> lab.cs.uwp.edu or sftp <login>@lab.cs.uwp.edu where <login> is your cs login. supply your cs password when prompted. you do not need to use a key. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i use one of the lockers in the lab? anyone with access to the lab may use a locker if any are available. the lockers are assigned on a first come, first served basis. in order to use a locker, you must register your intent with the cs system administrator. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? what are the lab rules? all guests must be escorted while in the lab. with the exception of special 'events' preapproved by the chairperson of the department, the cs computer lab is for use by cs students with a cs account only. treat the furniture well. make sure to wipe up spills at the conference table. keep your shoes off the furniture. return all items to their proper place. food and drinks are allowed on the north side of the lab by the conference table but not elsewhere. do not forget to log off completely and turn off the monitor when you are finished using a lab computer. (turning off the monitor saves power.) clean up your area when you are through working at either the conference table and/or a workstation. push your chair in and clean up your papers. recycle unwanted papers including the banner pages for printing jobs in the blue recycle containers. recycle cans and bottles in the appropriate container. other garbage goes in the brown lined container. offenders may lose access to the lab and/or to their account. repeat offenders will lose access. not keeping the lab clean and in good order could cause everyone to lose the privilege of having food and/or drink in the lab. see also: how do i log out? (unix) how do i log out? (windows) how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i contact the cs system administrator? the cs system administrator is heather miles. her office is moln d120c (inside the cs computer lab). a message could be taped to the door or put under the door if she is not there. her phone number is 595-2592. you can contact her by email here. how do i contact my cs instructor? your cs instructor's contact information should be on the syllabus for the class and is also available here. how do i view a pdf file? pdf files can be viewed by using adobe reader which is installed on the lab machines. open the file by double clicking on the file's icon. on unix machines pdf files can also be opened from the command line using the command acroread <path_to_pdf> where <path_to_pdf> is the path to the pdf file to be viewed. how do i create a word-type document? microsoft word is installed on the windows machines. it can be started by selecting start->all programs->microsoft office->microsoft word. on unix machines use open office writer. select applications->office->openoffice.org writer. open office writer can read and write microsoft word compatible documents. how can i run cs lab guis on my windows machine at home? contact the cs system administrator. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? what microsoft software can i get for free? the department in conjunction with the microsoft dreamspark (fka msdnaa) is pleased to bring you the opportunity to get free software. for very modest amounts, some of the software media is also available for purchase. you must be enrolled in a csci or cis class and have received an email with login information to take advantage of this offer. you will receive a new email each semester you are eligible. if interested, please visit our dreamspark website. when you download the software you may get an iso file which you will have to burn to a disc to use. the msdnaa website has instructions on how to do so here. see also: where do i go to get cheap software through the uw system? how do i get a free copy of vmware? where do i go to get cheap software through the uw system? the university of wisconsin system has a website where you can order a variety of software at a significant discount:http://wiscsoftware.wisc.edu/wisc/. to purchase software from this site you will need to use your parkside netid (email login and password), not your cs one. how do i get a free copy of vmware? the school of business and technology have an academic licensing agreement with vmware for licenses for educational and research purposes. please see the cs system administrator for more details. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? what if i run into problems? if you cannot find a solution to your problem in these faqs, contact your instructor or the cs system administrator. see also: how do i contact my cs instructor? how do i contact the cs system administrator? nothing printed, what do i do now? how do i read my cs email? you have two options for reading your cs email . it may be viewed through a program called alpine from any of the lab computers. to use alpine, open a terminal window and type alpine. then hit enter, enter to choose your inbox. alpine is completely keyboard driven, you cannot use your mouse. commands are listed on the bottom of the window. note that the ^ character refers to the control (ctrl) key. for example, ^x means to hold the control key and press x. documentation for alpine may be found here. second is using a program called thunderbird which is installed on the lab machines. instructions for setting thunderbird to read your cs email can be found here. communications from your instructors, the system administrator, or servers like the print server may be sent to this cs account. please check it regularly or set a forward to an account you check regularly. see also: how do i forward my cs email to another email account? how do i forward my cs email to another email account? in a terminal window type gedit ~/.forward type the email address of the account to which you want your cs email forwarded. save the file. close gedit. see also: how do i read my cs email? how is my email protected from spam and viruses? the cs email system scans emails for viruses and discards infected emails. spam is also scanned for and the worst of it is also discarded. unfortunately, some spam does get through. email with attachments with executable extensions are also discarded. for example, you will not be able to mail or receive any .exe files. how do i print something in the lab? (unix) most files can be printed by opening the file then printing it from the application by selecting print from the file menu and selecting the oneup or twoup printer as appropriate. text files can also be printed from the command line using lpr. in a terminal window, type lpr <path_to_file> where <path_to_file> is the path to the file you want to print. lpr prints twoup by default. use the command lpr -poneup <path_to_file> to print oneup. see also: how do i print two pages per piece of paper (twoup)? nothing printed, what do i do now? nothing printed, what do i do now? check your email. the printing system will send you an email if it encounters an error while attempting to print your document. check the printer settings. make sure that you have the correct printer selected.

What are my estimated fees and expenses for graduate work in the CIS program? Your full-time graduate tuition (based on 9 credits for Fall and Spring semesters and 3 credits for Summer) amounts to approximately $20800, based on the 2010-2011 nonresident fee schedule from the Cashier's Office. Your entire package of fees and expenses, including housing and other costs, will be approximately $32350: Tuition and fees: $20800 Housing and meal plan: 9000 Books and supplies: 900 Personal expenses: 2000 Medical insurance (reqd): 900 Total: $33600 This estimate of fees and expenses assumes that you have an F1 student visa and are required to take a full-time course of study. If your visa status does not require full-time study, you will normally take only 6 credits in Fall and Spring semesters; consequently, your tuition and fees will be lower. See Also: What can I expect my tuition costs to be per semester? As an international student, how would I qualify for resident tuition? As an international student, how would I qualify for resident tuition? You may apply for resident tuition if you have a record of high academic achievement and if you can show evidence that you are unable to pay for your expenses as a non-resident graduate student.

See Also: What financial aid is available for my graduate study? Am I able to begin taking courses without being accepted? No. To be eligible to study in the U.S., you must be accepted as a degree-seeking student. What is the difference between the CIS graduate degree program and graduate programs in CS or IS? The CIS degree at UW-Parkside is designed for students seeking credentials for entry into the information technology professional workforce or for those seeking professional advancement. The CIS curriculum is oriented more towards practicality than most graduate programs in CS, while providing more technically oriented study than most graduate programs in IS. What if I do not have an undergraduate degree in CS or MIS? It is not necessary to have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or Management Information Systems to be successful in our CIS program. If you have a solid math background which includes algebra and geometry, our two prerequisite classes, CSCI 145 or 241 and CSCI 242, will complete the preparation needed. See Also: How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? This depends on your prior coursework and background. Please see the list of prerequisite classes. See Also: Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? Normally, graduate-level classes in CS or MIS can be counted towards your CIS degree if the content is similar to CIS required courses. A maximum of 12 semester hours of graduate work may be transferred into the CIS program. Transfer eligibility depends on the content and level of those classes, and you must have received a B (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) or higher before they can be considered. See Also: What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? How long will it take me to complete my CIS degree? Without any prerequisite courses, plan to arrive for the fall semester and expect the CIS program to be completed in two years of full time study. With sufficient background, it is possible to complete the program in one-and-a-half years of full time study or three years of part-time study. See Also: How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? At what time of day and days of the week are CIS courses offered? Most CIS courses are offered in the evenings, but some classes may be offered during the day. Each summer one or two classes will be offered, or it is possible to arrange to complete a course through independent study. How do I burn an iso to a CD or DVD in the CS Computer Lab?

what are the application deadlines? application deadlines are:  semester date  fall august 1  spring december 15  summer april 15 international students requiring an i-20 form to study in the u.s. should apply at least two months prior to these deadlines. see also: as an international student, what additional information do i need to supply with my application? who should i ask to write letters of recommendation? you should seek letters of recommendation from those who are familiar with your academic work and who can comment with confidence on the likelihood of your success in graduate studies. you can also seek letters from employers who are familiar with your work habits and problem-solving abilities, though such letters should not be used exclusively. see also: should i have recommendation letters sent directly to uw-parkside? what should i include in my letter of application? what should i include in my letter of application? your letter should address your educational and career goals, including how your cis graduate studies will help to achieve these goals. if you believe your supporting documentation (including transcripts of prior academic work or test scores) may be viewed as deficient, your letter should address these deficiencies and should indicate why you believe you can be successful as a graduate student. see also: who should i ask to write letters of recommendation? should i have recommendation letters sent directly to uw-parkside? yes. have your recommendation letters sent directly to the department of computer science at uw-parkside. see also: who should i ask to write letters of recommendation?

what are the cutoff scores for the toefl? if your toefl score is at least 550 (paper based) or 213 (computer based), you are considered to have adequate english ability for graduate study at uw-parkside. if not, you may encounter some difficulties with the english language in your coursework and in your interaction with faculty and students. in such a case, we will review your application more carefully and may ask you to complete further study of english before we make an admission decision. what are my estimated fees and expenses for graduate work in the cis program? your full-time graduate tuition (based on 9 credits for fall and spring semesters and 3 credits for summer) amounts to approximately $20800, based on the 2010-2011 nonresident fee schedule from the cashier's office. your entire package of fees and expenses, including housing and other costs, will be approximately $32350: tuition and fees: $20800 housing and meal plan: 9000 books and supplies: 900 personal expenses: 2000 medical insurance (reqd): 900 total: $33600 this estimate of fees and expenses assumes that you have an f1 student visa and are required to take a full-time course of study. if your visa status does not require full-time study, you will normally take only 6 credits in fall and spring semesters; consequently, your tuition and fees will be lower. see also: what can i expect my tuition costs to be per semester? as an international student, how would i qualify for resident tuition? as an international student, how would i qualify for resident tuition? you may apply for resident tuition if you have a record of high academic achievement and if you can show evidence that you are unable to pay for your expenses as a non-resident graduate student. at your request, the department of computer science and the office of admissions will evaluate your academic record and financial sponsorship statement and will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not to grant you resident tuition. see also: what financial aid is available for my graduate study? am i able to begin taking courses without being accepted? no. to be eligible to study in the u.s., you must be accepted as a degree-seeking student. what is the difference between the cis graduate degree program and graduate programs in cs or is? the cis degree at uw-parkside is designed for students seeking credentials for entry into the information technology professional workforce or for those seeking professional advancement. the cis curriculum is oriented more towards practicality than most graduate programs in cs, while providing more technically oriented study than most graduate programs in is. what if i do not have an undergraduate degree in cs or mis? it is not necessary to have an undergraduate degree in computer science or management information systems to be successful in our cis program. if you have a solid math background which includes algebra and geometry, our two prerequisite classes, csci 145 or 241 and csci 242, will complete the preparation needed. see also: how many prerequisite classes will i need to take? what if i do not have a degree from a us college or university? how many prerequisite classes will i need to take? this depends on your prior coursework and background. please see the list of prerequisite classes. see also: which classes that i have already taken may count towards my cis degree? which classes that i have already taken may count towards my cis degree? normally, graduate-level classes in cs or mis can be counted towards your cis degree if the content is similar to cis required courses. a maximum of 12 semester hours of graduate work may be transferred into the cis program. transfer eligibility depends on the content and level of those classes, and you must have received a b (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) or higher before they can be considered. see also: what if i do not have a degree from a us college or university? how long will it take me to complete my cis degree? without any prerequisite courses, plan to arrive for the fall semester and expect the cis program to be completed in two years of full time study. with sufficient background, it is possible to complete the program in one-and-a-half years of full time study or three years of part-time study. see also: how many prerequisite classes will i need to take? which classes that i have already taken may count towards my cis degree? at what time of day and days of the week are cis courses offered? most cis courses are offered in the evenings, but some classes may be offered during the day. each summer one or two classes will be offered, or it is possible to arrange to complete a course through independent study.  university of wisconsin-parkside  900 wood road  po box 2000 kenosha, wi 53141-2000 262-595-2345  questions or comments?

The amount of the awards are based on the student's federal financial need and vary from year to year and student to student. The program is supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation S-STEM program. Funding began in Fall 2008.   Benefits Scholarships to cover tuition, room and board, books and supplies, up to a maximum of $10,000 annually.  The program also loans students laptops. The laptops are only loaned, and must be returned when the student graduates or leaves the program, so they be passed on to the next cohort of awardees. Students needing help with their laptops should contact Heather Miles in Moln D120, 595 - 2592, miles at uwp dot edu. A community mentorship program, where students are paired with community members in their fields of study to help guide them in their preparing for their professional lives. There are limited number of funds available to help students prepare for and take graduate school exams. Students may be  reimbursed for the purchase of study books, exam registration fees or other fees associated with the GRE or other graduate school exam.  Students wanting to be reimbursed for these expenses should see Connie Wheeler in Moln 248, 595 - 2314, wheelerc at uwp dot edu. If an awardee is involved in a research project, or has other reasons to attend a conference, e.g. if the conference is a good venue to explore graduate studies, we have some resources to support travel. Please see Professor Hansen, Moln 251, 595-3395, hansen at uwp dot edu, to discuss available funding. Eligibility To be eligible, a student must: be of junior standing at the beginning of the award period, have a GPA of at least 3.0 at their current post-secondary institution, take at least 12 credit hours each semester they are in the program, have declared a major in Biological Sciences, Molecular Biology and Bioinformatics, Chemistry, Computer Science, Geoscience, or Physics, and qualify for federal financial aid.

(unix) how do i print something in the lab? (windows) how do i contact the cs system administrator? what does cs mean? cs stands for computer science. how do i use the card reader? make sure the light on the card reader is green. hold your ranger card so that the magnetic strip is on the right and swipe it through the card reader. the light will flash amber. enter your pin using the numbers on the card reader. the light will flash green and the reader will make a beeping sound for 5 seconds. pull the door open before it stops. if the lights flash red, try again. if trying to access the lab fails repeatedly, contact your cs instructor or the cs system administrator. see also: what do i do if the light on the card reader is not green? how do i contact my cs instructor? how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i access my computer account in the cs computer lab? if you qualify, you will be given an account on cs.uwp.edu. before using the account you must fill out and sign a unix account policy form and do the initial setup of your account. for most people, this is done in the first lab of the csci 145 or 241 course. if for some reason you did not activate your account, contact the cs system administrator for assistance. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i choose a good password? the password you select for the cs computer lab must be a minimum of 8 characters long and contain at least one letter at least one number and at least one symbol. your password should be easy for you to remember and secure enough no one can guess it. your password should not contain any public information such as address, phone number, birthday, pet name, etc. which would be easy to find out or guess. your password should be long and should not contain any commonly known words. your password should contain a mixture of upper and lower case letters, numbers, and other characters such as punctuation marks or symbols. keep your password secure. this includes not telling anyone what your password is. you should use a different password for every account you access. for greater security, passwords should be changed regularly. see also: what are some methods for choosing a good password? how do i change my cs password? what should i do if i forget my password? what are some methods for choosing a good password? choose a word and replace some of the letters with numbers or symbols so that the original word is unrecognizable. or choose a phrase, such as the first line of your favorite song, use the first letter of each word of the phrase, and insert punctuation marks and numbers. or choose a common word, but as you type it offset your fingers on the keyboard one or two places up, down, or sideways. the typed word will then look like gibberish. or the possibilities are endless, use your own method. see also: how do i choose a good password? how do i change my cs password? what should i do if i forget my password? how do i use the computers in the cs computer lab? (unix) typically, all machines are powered up, with the monitors turned off. turn on monitor. if the screen is black, move the mouse or press the escape key to wake it up. if the screen is locked, or someone forgot to log out, report it to the cs system administrator. enter your cs login and password. remember to log off when done. if you are only going to be gone 2 or 3 minutes, lock your screen and leave your books/papers by the workstation. do not turn off any of the computers. these are accessed from remote locations and others may be using them at the same time. (except for the dual-boot machines. if you are not sure if a machine is dual-boot, do not shut it down or restart it.) if there is a problem with a machine, please notify the cs system administrator. see also: how do i log in to the computers in the cs computer lab? (unix) how do i lock my machine? (unix) how do i log out? (unix) how do i change my cs password? you must change your password on the lab server. from a terminal session logged into the lab: type the command ssh ginger and press enter. if you see a message that looks like the following: the authenticity of host 'ginger (131.210.12.7)' can't be established. rsa key fingerprint is 89:b8:3b:12:7b:c7:0d:93:09:c2:4b:f8:5f:71:7f:6f. are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? type yes and press enter. enter your password. nothing will show up on the screen as you type. this is done for security purposes. you should see this: ==================================================== you may only change your password on this server type ctrl-d to exit without changing your password ==================================================== changing password for username (current) unix password: enter your current password. nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. enter your new password. again, nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. enter your new password again. once again, nothing will show on the screen as you type. press enter. you will see the message passwd: password updated successfully. the connection will close and you will be returned to the lab machine. see also: how do i choose a good password? what are some methods for choosing a good password? what should i do if i forget my password? how do i get a secure login to the cs computer lab from the outside world? (unix) use ssh (secure shell). secure shell encrypts the terminal connection including your password so no data is transmitted in clear, readable text. the lab machines are not accessible from off campus using telnet or ftp. to access the lab with ssh, you will need to get an ssh client (workstation) software installed on the machine you want to access the lab from. it should be installed by default on a unix machine. to access the lab type the command ssh -l <login> lab.cs.uwp.edu or sftp <login>@lab.cs.uwp.edu where <login> is your cs login. supply your cs password when prompted. you do not need to use a key. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i use one of the lockers in the lab? anyone with access to the lab may use a locker if any are available. the lockers are assigned on a first come, first served basis. in order to use a locker, you must register your intent with the cs system administrator. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? what are the lab rules? all guests must be escorted while in the lab. with the exception of special 'events' preapproved by the chairperson of the department, the cs computer lab is for use by cs students with a cs account only. treat the furniture well. make sure to wipe up spills at the conference table. keep your shoes off the furniture. return all items to their proper place. food and drinks are allowed on the north side of the lab by the conference table but not elsewhere. do not forget to log off completely and turn off the monitor when you are finished using a lab computer. (turning off the monitor saves power.) clean up your area when you are through working at either the conference table and/or a workstation. push your chair in and clean up your papers. recycle unwanted papers including the banner pages for printing jobs in the blue recycle containers. recycle cans and bottles in the appropriate container. other garbage goes in the brown lined container. offenders may lose access to the lab and/or to their account. repeat offenders will lose access. not keeping the lab clean and in good order could cause everyone to lose the privilege of having food and/or drink in the lab. see also: how do i log out? (unix) how do i log out? (windows) how do i contact the cs system administrator? how do i contact the cs system administrator? the cs system administrator is heather miles. her office is moln d120c (inside the cs computer lab). a message could be taped to the door or put under the door if she is not there. her phone number is 595-2592. you can contact her by email here. how do i contact my cs instructor? your cs instructor's contact information should be on the syllabus for the class and is also available here. how do i view a pdf file? pdf files can be viewed by using adobe reader which is installed on the lab machines. open the file by double clicking on the file's icon. on unix machines pdf files can also be opened from the command line using the command acroread <path_to_pdf> where <path_to_pdf> is the path to the pdf file to be viewed. how do i create a word-type document? microsoft word is installed on the windows machines. it can be started by selecting start->all programs->microsoft office->microsoft word. on unix machines use open office writer. select applications->office->openoffice.org writer. open office writer can read and write microsoft word compatible documents. how can i run cs lab guis on my windows machine at home? contact the cs system administrator. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? what microsoft software can i get for free? the department in conjunction with the microsoft dreamspark (fka msdnaa) is pleased to bring you the opportunity to get free software. for very modest amounts, some of the software media is also available for purchase. you must be enrolled in a csci or cis class and have received an email with login information to take advantage of this offer. you will receive a new email each semester you are eligible. if interested, please visit our dreamspark website. when you download the software you may get an iso file which you will have to burn to a disc to use. the msdnaa website has instructions on how to do so here. see also: where do i go to get cheap software through the uw system? how do i get a free copy of vmware? where do i go to get cheap software through the uw system? the university of wisconsin system has a website where you can order a variety of software at a significant discount:http://wiscsoftware.wisc.edu/wisc/. to purchase software from this site you will need to use your parkside netid (email login and password), not your cs one. how do i get a free copy of vmware? the school of business and technology have an academic licensing agreement with vmware for licenses for educational and research purposes. please see the cs system administrator for more details. see also: how do i contact the cs system administrator? what if i run into problems? if you cannot find a solution to your problem in these faqs, contact your instructor or the cs system administrator. see also: how do i contact my cs instructor? how do i contact the cs system administrator? nothing printed, what do i do now? how do i read my cs email? you have two options for reading your cs email . it may be viewed through a program called alpine from any of the lab computers. to use alpine, open a terminal window and type alpine. then hit enter, enter to choose your inbox. alpine is completely keyboard driven, you cannot use your mouse. commands are listed on the bottom of the window. note that the ^ character refers to the control (ctrl) key. for example, ^x means to hold the control key and press x. documentation for alpine may be found here. second is using a program called thunderbird which is installed on the lab machines. instructions for setting thunderbird to read your cs email can be found here. communications from your instructors, the system administrator, or servers like the print server may be sent to this cs account. please check it regularly or set a forward to an account you check regularly. see also: how do i forward my cs email to another email account? how do i forward my cs email to another email account? in a terminal window type gedit ~/.forward type the email address of the account to which you want your cs email forwarded. save the file. close gedit. see also: how do i read my cs email? how is my email protected from spam and viruses? the cs email system scans emails for viruses and discards infected emails. spam is also scanned for and the worst of it is also discarded. unfortunately, some spam does get through. email with attachments with executable extensions are also discarded. for example, you will not be able to mail or receive any .exe files. how do i print something in the lab? (unix) most files can be printed by opening the file then printing it from the application by selecting print from the file menu and selecting the oneup or twoup printer as appropriate. text files can also be printed from the command line using lpr. in a terminal window, type lpr <path_to_file> where <path_to_file> is the path to the file you want to print. lpr prints twoup by default. use the command lpr -poneup <path_to_file> to print oneup. see also: how do i print two pages per piece of paper (twoup)? nothing printed, what do i do now? nothing printed, what do i do now? check your email. the printing system will send you an email if it encounters an error while attempting to print your document. check the printer settings. make sure that you have the correct printer selected.

If your institution is unable to provide official transcripts, you will need to obtain documentation from an official source indicating the nature of your studies and their equivalents. If all or part of your studies were taken abroad, you may use the services of a credit evaluation agency that can verify your educational background and provide US equivalents. See Also: As an international student, what additional information do I need to supply with my application? What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? Are unofficial transcripts acceptable? What does the "consent of instructor" course prerequisite mean? Most CIS core courses have a prerequisite of "consent of instructor". Students who have completed the prerequisite courses and who follow their peer group by taking Foundation and Core courses in proper rotation will automatically satisfy the course prerequisites. Those who take courses out of rotation or who are starting their degree requirements with some transfer credits may need to discuss their preparation with the instructor. What can I expect my tuition costs to be per semester? Your actual tuition costs will depend on the tuition schedule for the semesters in which you enroll. See the Cashier's Office Fee Facts Booklet for full information about tuition and fees for the current semester. See Also: What financial aid is available for my graduate study? What financial aid is available for my graduate study? Graduate students who are at least half-time status (5 credits) and have applied for federal student financial aid through the FAFSA form are eligible to receive federal Stafford student loans. For more information, contact the Office Financial Aid at 262-595-2574. See Also: What can I expect my tuition costs to be per semester? As an international student, what additional information do I need to supply with my application? You must provide evidence of financial support and copies of your passport and visa indicating that you are eligible to study in the United States. A financial sponsorship form should be submitted with the information indicated on this form to the Department of Computer Science for review along with your other information in support of your application. See Also: What items should be included in my application? Am I able to begin taking courses without being accepted? What if my visa status requires that I be a full-time student? The CIS program can be completed as a full-time student (9 credits per semester for graduate students.) See Also: Am I able to begin taking courses without being accepted? What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? You must have your foreign credits evaluated by a recognized evaluation agency. The evaluation should clearly indicate you have achieved the US equivalent of a BS or BA and should give a list of all courses you have taken along with their associated US equivalent credits and grades. You are responsible for paying for this evaluation and for having the evaluation sent directly to the Department of Computer Science (or for providing a copy of the evaluation in a sealed envelope properly authenticated by the agency). We recommend the following agency: Educational Credential Evaluators, Inc. P.O. Box 514070 Milwaukee WI 53203-3470 USA phone: 414-289-3400 http://www.ece.org You may obtain a list of acceptable evaluation agencies by consulting the National Association of Credit Evaluation Services (NACES) web site. See Also: Are unofficial transcripts acceptable? What if my institution cannot provide official transcripts? Do I need to take the TOEFL? If English is not your native language, you are required to provide evidence of English language competence, normally by presenting a degree from an English-speaking university or by satisfactory scores on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), administered by the Educational Testing Service: Corporate Headquarters Educational Testing Service Rosedale Road Princeton, NJ 08541 USA phone:609-921-9000 You are responsible for paying for this test and for seeing that your test scores are sent directly to the Department of Computer Science. See Also: What are the cutoff scores for the TOEFL? What are the cutoff scores for the TOEFL? If your TOEFL score is at least 550 (paper based) or 213 (computer based), you are considered to have adequate English ability for graduate study at UW-Parkside. If not, you may encounter some difficulties with the English language in your coursework and in your interaction with faculty and students. In such a case, we will review your application more carefully and may ask you to complete further study of English before we make an admission decision. What are my estimated fees and expenses for graduate work in the CIS program? Your full-time graduate tuition (based on 9 credits for Fall and Spring semesters and 3 credits for Summer) amounts to approximately $20800, based on the 2010-2011 nonresident fee schedule from the Cashier's Office. Your entire package of fees and expenses, including housing and other costs, will be approximately $32350: Tuition and fees: $20800 Housing and meal plan: 9000 Books and supplies: 900 Personal expenses: 2000 Medical insurance (reqd): 900 Total: $33600 This estimate of fees and expenses assumes that you have an F1 student visa and are required to take a full-time course of study. If your visa status does not require full-time study, you will normally take only 6 credits in Fall and Spring semesters; consequently, your tuition and fees will be lower. See Also: What can I expect my tuition costs to be per semester? As an international student, how would I qualify for resident tuition? As an international student, how would I qualify for resident tuition? You may apply for resident tuition if you have a record of high academic achievement and if you can show evidence that you are unable to pay for your expenses as a non-resident graduate student. At your request, the Department of Computer Science and the Office of Admissions will evaluate your academic record and financial sponsorship statement and will determine, on a case-by-case basis, whether or not to grant you resident tuition. See Also: What financial aid is available for my graduate study? Am I able to begin taking courses without being accepted? No. To be eligible to study in the U.S., you must be accepted as a degree-seeking student. What is the difference between the CIS graduate degree program and graduate programs in CS or IS? The CIS degree at UW-Parkside is designed for students seeking credentials for entry into the information technology professional workforce or for those seeking professional advancement. The CIS curriculum is oriented more towards practicality than most graduate programs in CS, while providing more technically oriented study than most graduate programs in IS. What if I do not have an undergraduate degree in CS or MIS? It is not necessary to have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science or Management Information Systems to be successful in our CIS program. If you have a solid math background which includes algebra and geometry, our two prerequisite classes, CSCI 145 or 241 and CSCI 242, will complete the preparation needed. See Also: How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? This depends on your prior coursework and background. Please see the list of prerequisite classes. See Also: Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? Normally, graduate-level classes in CS or MIS can be counted towards your CIS degree if the content is similar to CIS required courses. A maximum of 12 semester hours of graduate work may be transferred into the CIS program. Transfer eligibility depends on the content and level of those classes, and you must have received a B (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) or higher before they can be considered. See Also: What if I do not have a degree from a US college or university? How long will it take me to complete my CIS degree? Without any prerequisite courses, plan to arrive for the fall semester and expect the CIS program to be completed in two years of full time study. With sufficient background, it is possible to complete the program in one-and-a-half years of full time study or three years of part-time study. See Also: How many prerequisite classes will I need to take? Which classes that I have already taken may count towards my CIS degree? At what time of day and days of the week are CIS courses offered? Most CIS courses are offered in the evenings, but some classes may be offered during the day. Each summer one or two classes will be offered, or it is possible to arrange to complete a course through independent study. How do I burn an iso to a CD or DVD in the CS Computer Lab?
